      <h2>Metal Gear (1987)</h2>
      <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0003/9485/4447/products/Metal_Gear_1200x1200.png?v=1531028280"
        alt="Metal Gear">
      <p>His first notable work. Acts as prequel for the Solid series.</p>
      <p>The game revolves around Solid Snake, an operative of the special forces unit FOXHOUND, who goes on a solo
        infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy "Metal Gear", a bipedal walking tank
        capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world, as well as rescue a number of fellow agents
        who
        have been captured by the enemy. The game was a major international success, with the NES version selling 1
        million units in the United States.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake (1990)</h2>
      <img src="https://e.snmc.io/lk/lv/x/f93d7166026fcf4b2fb64e42008b68c9/5297941" alt="Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake">
      <p>His second notable work. Sequel to Metal Gear (1987)</p>
      <p>Set in 1999, a few years after the events of the original game, Solid Snake must infiltrate a heavily defended
        territory known as Zanzibar Land to rescue a kidnapped scientist and destroy the revised "Metal Gear D". The
        game
        significantly evolved the stealth-based game system of its predecessor "in almost every way", introduced a
        complex
        storyline dealing with themes such as the nature of warfare and nuclear proliferation, and is considered "one of
        the best 8 bit games ever made."</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Metal Gear Solid (1998)</h2>
      <img src="https://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/metal-gear-solid-sale-playstation-store.jpg.optimal.jpg"
        alt="Metal Gear Solid">
      <p>Metal Gear Solid is a game where the protagonist returns to deal with FOXHOUND. The game is famous for its
        unorthodox boss battle with Psycho Mantis, where the boss can read the inside of player's memory card (and made
        various comments of famous games if it knows about it) and able to dodge all your attacks unless the player
        unplugged the controller from first port and plugged it to the second port.</p>
      <p>The game follows Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralize the terrorist
        threat from FOXHOUND, a renegade special forces unit. Snake must liberate two hostages, the head of DARPA and
        the
        president of a major arms manufacturer, confront the terrorists, and stop them from launching a nuclear
        strike.Cinematic cutscenes were rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, and voice acting was used
        throughout the entire game.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="anchorMGS2">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001)</h2>
      <img src="https://www.androidguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shield-metal-gear-solid-2-screenshots-1.jpg"
        alt="Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001)">
      <p>The game is considered to be ahead of its time, dealing with themes that later became culturally relevant in
        the
        2010s, drawing comparisons to concepts such as social media, news feeds, post-truth politics, fake news,
        alternative facts and echo chambers.</p>
      <p>The story revolves around the "Big Shell", a massive offshore clean-up facility seized by a group of terrorists
        who call themselves the "Sons of Liberty". They demand a massive ransom in exchange for the life of the
        President
        of the United States and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental disaster if
        their
        demands are not met. The motives and identities of many of the antagonists and allies change throughout the
        course
        of the game, as the protagonists discover a world-shaking conspiracy constructed by a powerful organization
        known
        as the Patriots.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</h2>
      <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8viw1u3Fkgg/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater">
      <p>Another game that's famous for its boss battle. The boss, <a
          href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/The_End">The
          End</a>, can be dealt in a very unusual way if the player is having trouble in the sniper battle. Because of
        the
        game plot setting, The End is very old and thus death is near for him. By saving the game, quit and set the PS2
        time system to two weeks forward, then by the time the players get into the game, The End is already defeated,
        because he is dead by old age, and the story progresses automatically.</p>
      <p>There's also a hidden easter egg if the player kill an antagonist that should not have died in this game. The
        antagonist would appear at later timeline (this game is a prequel of everything else in the series except Metal
        Gear Solid V), so if the player kills him, the series effectively ends. The game ackowledges this by giving the
        sign "Time Paradox" instead of "Game Over" screen if you do kill the antagonist.</p>
      <p>Set in 1964 (thirty years before the events of the original Metal Gear), the story centers on the FOX operative
        codenamed Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a Russian rocket scientist by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich
        Sokolov, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected former boss. While previous games
        were
        set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle setting,[1] with the high tech,
        near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting
        has
        changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential,
        fourth-wall-breaking sense of humor. The story of Snake Eater is told through numerous cutscenes and radio
        conversations.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (2008)</h2>
      <img src="https://jagatplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mgs-4-ending.jpg"
        alt="Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots">
      <p>If previous games is famous for the unique bosses, this one is <em>(in)</em>famous for it's ending cutscene
        which
        lasts for 1 Hour 52 seconds (that's 01:00:52 duration). The ending itself can be considered a movie by its own.
      </p>
      <p>Set five years after the events of <a href="#anchorMGS2">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a>, the story
        centers around a prematurely aged Solid Snake, now known as Old Snake, as he goes on one last mission to
        assassinate his nemesis Liquid Snake, who now inhabits the body of his former henchman Revolver Ocelot under the
        guise of Liquid Ocelot, before he takes control of the Sons of the Patriots, an A.I. system that controls the
        activities of PMCs worldwide.</p>
      <p>This game in the series is the ending of the whole Metal Gear saga, but not the final game, because there are
        still unanswered questions in the series.</p>

      <h2>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (2015)</h2>

        alt="Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (2015)">
      <p>Set in 1984, nine years after the events of Ground Zeroes and eleven years before the events of the original
        Metal Gear, the story follows mercenary leader Punished "Venom" Snake as he ventures into Soviet-occupied
        Afghanistan and the Angola–Zaire border region to exact revenge on the people who destroyed his forces and came
        close to killing him during the climax of Ground Zeroes. It carries over the tagline of Tactical Espionage
        Operations first used in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. </p>
      <p>This game is the final game before <a href="https://www.pauseresume.com/the-full-story-hideo-kojima-and-konami/"
