    <h2 class="indexH2">Biography</h2>
    <div class="indexPharagraph">
      <p>Kojima was born on August 24, 1963, in Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan where he was raised until the age of 4 alongside
        his two older siblings. The family then moved to Osaka but instead of settling there, the family will move again
        to Shirasaki and then Kawanishi, Hyōgo. Unfortunately for him, he would lose his father when he was just 13.</p>
      <p>What he dreamt of becoming as a little kid was an artist or a filmmaker, but there was the idea that those
        would hardly pay the bills and he needed a stable job as his uncle was also an artist but was finding it very
        hard to make a living.</p>
      <p>Contrary to what you might have brought yourself to believe, the Japanese video game designer did not study
        anything that got him where he is today at first. Instead, it was economic that he started studying, although at
        the time he was also into short story writing, none of which he was able to get published in the numerous
        magazines he submitted them to.</p>
      <p>Having spent his years in the university playing video games such as Super Mario Bros. (1985) and The Portopia
        Serial Murder Case (1983), Hideo decided to go into the video gaming industry once he was through with his
        education. He joined Konami’s MSX in 1986 where he began his career as a designer and planner.</p>
